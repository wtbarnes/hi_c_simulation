# Synthesizing the Observation of AR 12712 by the Hi-C Sounding Rocket
The Hi-C sounding rocket had its 3rd flight on 29 May 2018 at approximately 1 PM Eastern Standard time. It was launched from the White Sands Missile range and observed AR NOAA 12712. The data from that observation has not yet been released.

In this repository, we will simulate the observation of AR 12712 in the 171 Ã… passband of the instrument.
